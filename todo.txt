Dreams:
- implement file update/creation/deletion checking using inotify
  (see sun.nio.fs.LinuxWatchService for an example)
- implement file update/creation/deletion checking using java.nio.file in java 7
- implement concurrency through Actors
- formal test infrastructure

TODO:
- check hash on a client's files upon connection to the server
- implement version vectors for already-connected clients
- file level locking instead of hash map level lockings
- implement encryption with nonces
- (more) gracefully handle errors
- check hashes upon file transfers and writes to detect errors
- avoid subtle bugs

Design Questions:
- what to do about clients connecting with additional files in their home folders?
  currently they are ignored, although deletion will trigger a RemovedMessage

Outstanding bugs:
- deleting a non-empty directory does not behave correctly
- possible race condition: updating files during reads
