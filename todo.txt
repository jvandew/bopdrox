Dreams:
- implement file update/creation/deletion checking using inotify in a separate branch
  (see sun.nio.fs.LinuxWatchService for an example)
- implement file update/creation/deletion checking using java.nio.file in java 7 in a
  separate branch
- implement concurrency through Actors in a separate branch

TODO:
- check timestamp on a client's files upon connection to the server
- implement version vectors for already-connected clients
- implement encryption with nonces
- (more) gracefully handle errors
- check hashes upon file transfers and writes to detect errors
- avoid subtle bugs

Design Questions:
- what to do about clients connecting with additional files in their home folders?
  currently they are ignored, although deletion will trigger a RemovedMessage

Outstanding bugs:
- deleting a non-empty directory does not behave correctly
