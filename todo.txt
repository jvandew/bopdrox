- implement file update/creation/deletion checking using inotify in a separate branch

- implement timestamp checking on a client's files upon connection to the server
- implement version vectors for already-connected clients
- implement encryption
- fix cross-platform issues with storing file pathnames
- implement fault tolerance for incorrect wire transfers
- other race conditions exist when updating Server.hashes and Server.clients
- implement multiple clients
- gracefully handle errors and disconnects
- check hashes upon file writes to detect errors
- avoid subtle bugs

Outstanding bugs:
- RemovedMessage sent upon Client instantiation; seems to be no-op
- deleting a non-empty directory does not behave correctly
