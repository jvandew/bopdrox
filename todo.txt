- implement file update/creation/deletion checking using inotify in a separate branch
  (see sun.nio.fs.LinuxWatchService for an example)
- implement file update/creation/deletion checking using java.nio.file in java 7 in a
  separate branch
- implement timestamp checking on a client's files upon connection to the server
- implement version vectors for already-connected clients
- implement encryption with nonces
- what to do about clients connecting with additional files in their home folders?
  currently they are ignored, although deletion will trigger a RemovedMessage
- other race conditions exist when updating Server.hashes and Server.clients
- gracefully handle errors
- check hashes upon file transfers and writes to detect errors
- define serialVersionUID for Messages to allow use of different compilers
- this is a personal (single user) server so concurrency issues can be ignored
  for the most part, however this is somethng to look at fixing in the future
- avoid subtle bugs

Outstanding bugs:
- deleting a non-empty directory does not behave correctly
